Every year, an estimated 1.19 million people lose their lies in road traffic accidents, while another 20 to 50 million suffer non-fatal injuries. Many of them resulting in long-term disabilities. From a young age, we’re taught the golden rules of safe driving: don’t drink and drive, obey speed limits and avoid getting behind the wheel during bad weather. But how much truth is there to that las piece of advice? Is it really unsafe to drive in the rain or snow, or do we just assume it is? And when an accident happen, who or what is truly at fault? Is it human error: speeding, distraction, poor decisions, bad infrastructures, or does the weather itself play a more significant role than we thing. In what ways does weather influence traffic accidents.

To explore these questions, we’ll take a closer look at traffic accidents in New York City and their relationship with weather conditions. The goal is to understand whether these incidents are primarily dirven by human factors or significantly influenced by external forces like the weather. New York is an ideal case study. It experiences a wide range of weather conditions, from heavy snowfall in winter to hot, humid summers. Combined with its dense population and fast-paced urban life, the city provides a rich dataset that allows us to examine both environmental and human variables in a complex, high-pressure setting. Its chaotic and highly populated nature makes it the pefect environment to observe how weather and human behavior intersect on the road.

    <title>Is It Just Bad Driving - or is the Weather to Blame</title>
  </head>

Every year, an estimated 1.19 million people lose their lies in road traffic accidents, while another 20 to 50 million suffer non-fatal injuries. Many of them resulting in long-term disabilities. From a young age, we’re taught the golden rules of safe driving: don’t drink and drive, obey speed limits and avoid getting behind the wheel during bad weather. But how much truth is there to that las piece of advice? Is it really unsafe to drive in the rain or snow, or do we just assume it is? And when an accident happen, who or what is truly at fault? Is it human error: speeding, distraction, poor decisions, bad infrastructures, or does the weather itself play a more significant role than we thing. In what ways does weather influence traffic accidents.

To explore these questions, we’ll take a closer look at traffic accidents in New York City and their relationship with weather conditions. The goal is to understand whether these incidents are primarily dirven by human factors or significantly influenced by external forces like the weather. New York is an ideal case study. It experiences a wide range of weather conditions, from heavy snowfall in winter to hot, humid summers. Combined with its dense population and fast-paced urban life, the city provides a rich dataset that allows us to examine both environmental and human variables in a complex, high-pressure setting. Its chaotic and highly populated nature makes it the pefect environment to observe how weather and human behavior intersect on the road. 

When looking at traffic accidents by year, 2017 clearly stands out as the peak, recording the highest number of incidents. From 2012 to 2017, the number of traffic accidents increased, with its highest poing in 2017. After that peak, the numbers begin to decline, with a small  drop in 2018 and 2019. Then, in 2020 there is a noticeable decrease, like influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns, which heavily influenced urban mobility, prob. From 2021 to 2024, accident numbers continued to fall, though at a more stable rate, reaching similar levels to 2012. The change of traffic accidents from 2021 to 2024 is probably influenced by commuting behavior, remote work, and fewer vehicles on the road due to the pandemic. 

Accidents per borough -- Borough Breakdown: Who's at Higher Risk?

To better understand where accidents are most concentrated within the city, we turn to a borough-level analysis for the years 2017–2018. The spatial distribution of incidents reveals striking differences across New York’s five boroughs, shedding light on how geography, infrastructure, and population dynamics shape road safety.

The map presents a clear spatial distribution of traffic accidents across New York City's boroughs between 2017 and 2018. Unsurprisingly, Brooklyn and Queens exhibit the darkest shades, indicating the highest number of traffic accidents, likely reflecting their larger populations, greater roadway networks, and high vehicle ownership. Despite its smaller size, Manhattan also shows a high accident count, possibly due to dense traffic volumes, tourism, and a high rate of pedestrian activity.

In contrast, Staten Island and the Bronx recorded significantly fewer accidents, with Staten Island having the lowest count, consistent with its lower population density and more suburban layout.
This geographical trend underscores how urban density, transportation habits, and borough-specific infrastructure can influence traffic safety outcomes.

Accidents per hour of the day: 

When analyzing traffic accidents by hour of the day across NYC boroughs: Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island, a consisten daily pattern emerges. Accidents are most frequent between noon and 6 PM, likely reflecting the combined effects of midday traffic and afternoon rush hour. After 6 PM there a slight dip, but interestingly, a noticeable spike occurs again around 9 PM. Following that, the number of accidents drops significantly between 10 PM and 5 AM, where the road activity is generally lower. At 6 AM, there is a noticeable spike, possibly linked to early commuters, though the pattern briefly dips again at 7AM before rising once more as the day progresses. 

Several interesing patterns emerge from this graph. The notable peak around 3 PM and 4 PM may correspond to school dismissals and afternoon traffic congestion. On the other hand, the lowest number of incidents occurs between 1 AM and 5 AM, likely due to minimal traffic volume. However, the accidents that do happen during these hours could be related to driver fatigue, alcohol consumption or poor visibility. This suggests that while collisions are less frequent overnight, they may be more severe or fatal due to the risky conditions in which they happen since alcohol consumption is one of the main causes of traffic fatalities [1].

What stands out is the consistency of this hourly pattern across all boroughs, suggesting that time of day plays a more significant role in predicting accident frequency that geographic location alone. While some boroughs report more accidents overall, likely due to higher population density or traffic flow, this shared temporal rhythm implies a strong behavioral influence. 

Additionally, the unexpected spike around 9 PM could be linked to post-dinner activities, outings, events or nighttime driving routines. Insights like these are valuable for resource planning and public safety strategies, such as increasing patrol presence during high-risk hours or launching targeted awareness campaigns during the evening peak. 

In terms of the weather:

The climate in New York throughout 2017 shows clear seasonal variation. Temperatures are highest from June to September, with July and August reaching peak averages of 25.1ºC and 24.5ºC, respectively. On the other end, the coldest months fall between December and March, with January averaging as low as 0.5ºC. The transitional months, April, May, October and November, present moderate temperatures. 

In terms of precipitation, March stands out as the month with most snow, followed by January and February, making the core of winter. There’s also a peak in snowfall in November and December, indicating the onset of colder conditions. During the summer months and the months prior and after it, snowfall drops to zero. 
When it comes to rainfall, July and August are the rainiest months alongside May, which also sees a high level of precipitation. Interestingly, June is one of the driest months, just before precipitation peaks in midsummer. Overall, NYC experiences a full range of weather conditions throughout the year, making it an ideal setting to explore how temperature and precipitation may impact traffic accidents.
